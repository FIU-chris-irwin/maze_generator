# maze_generator
Generates Random Solvable Mazes 

generator.py creates mazes of user-specified dimensions and barrier density, checks that the maze has a solution, and writes the maze to a text file. 

NOTE: the user input may not run from the console output of an IDE (looking at you, VS Code...). If that is the case, run the program from the terminal with python generator.py
